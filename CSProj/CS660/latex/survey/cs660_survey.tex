% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.

% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:

% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,

\section{Introduction}

An \emph{Indoor positioning system} locates the objects or people in an indoor environment.
The information used for localization includes radio waves, magnetic fields, acoustic signals or other sensory information from mobile devices.

Indoor localization enables indoor navigation in shopping malls, indoor location-based advertisements, friends and family member tracking and etc.

\section{GPS assisted localization}
\label{sec:gps_local}

Due to low signal strength and multipath effect, usually the GPS receiver does not work well in an indoor building.
The indoor signal strength can be reduced 10 to 100 times of that in outdoor.

\cite{Nirjon:2014:CIL:2594368.2594378} proposes a hardware-software approach \emph{COIN-GPS}, which is a highly-sensitivity cloud-offloaded instant GPS.
It consists of three components,
\begin{itemize}
\item a directional antenna,
\item a robust acquisition algorithm and
\item a multi-directional location estimation algorithm.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Robust acquisition}
Because of the signal noise, the peak detection in common acquisition becomes difficult.
The use of a directional antenna helps reduce the noise.
 
\subsection{Multi-direction location estimation}
