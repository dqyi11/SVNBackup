% This command fixes my particular printer, which starts 0.03 inches too low,
% shifting the whole page down by that amount.  This shifts the document
% content up so that it comes out right when printed.
%
% Discovering this sort of behavior is best done by specifying the ``grid''
% option in the class parameters above.  It prints a 1/2 inch grid on every
% page.  You can then use a ruler to determine exactly what the printer is
% doing.
%
% Uncomment to shift content up (accounting for printer problems)
%\setlength{\voffset}{-.03in}

% Here we set things up for invisible hyperlinks in the document.  This makes

% prints.  It's useful, but optional.  Note that if you use latex instead of
% pdflatex, you should change "pdftex" to "ps2pdf".
