Improvements in robot autonomy is changing the human-robot interaction from low-level manipulation to high-level task-based collaboration.
When the robot can independently and autonomously execute the tasks, the role of the human in a human-robot team is a collaborator and a task supervisor~\cite{Goodrich2013,Yi2014b}.
How the robot could understand the human's intent and how the robot responds to the environment dynamic and uncertainty determine the collaborative performance and the interaction experience.

In guiding the robot's decision making, the tasks are often modeled into optimization problems. 
As the made decision, an optimized solution leads how the robot should execute the task.

\section{Introduction}
% 1-2 pages
% Answers:
% 1) What problem do you want to solve?
% 2) Who cares about this problem and why?

Although the robot intelligence is made by simulating human rationality, the ways how robot and the human think are still very different.
The human is expertized at making qualitative decision, from low-level movement to high-level reasoning.
While the robot shows great strength of solving quantitative problem, like high data-processing speed, high precisely repeated motion and etc.
In organizing the human and the robot in a team, the difference between the human and the robot should be considered in order to maximize the team performance.
When the human and the robot collaborate together, they are usually assigned different roles.
The human works on the high level, including high-level planning and scheduling, splitting the task into subtasks for different teammates, reacting to the situation changes.  
The robot works on the lower level, including low-level planning and task execution.

In a collaborative team, the shared mental model helps explaining the team functioning~\cite{Jonker:2010:SMM:2018118.2018128}.

The mutual understanding in the collaboration between the human and the robot is important to the team performance.
[Discuss the influence of bad mutual understanding]
[priori + online]
There are a few methods to help the human understand the robot, like training and interactive display.
Having the robot understand the human is more difficult, because of the asymmetry in how the human and the robot process information.

%Like any collaboration in a shared environment, the mutual understanding and the information sharing between the robot and the human determine the team performance.
%By the training and a few interactive technologies, the human could better read what is happening to the robot.
