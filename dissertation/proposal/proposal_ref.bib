  Title                    = {Search-Based Path Planning with Homotopy Class Constraints},
  __markedentry            = {[daqing_yi:6]},
  Abstract                 = {Goal-directed path planning is one of the basic and widely studied problems in the field of mobile robotics. Homotopy classes of trajectories, arising due to the presence of obstacles, are defined as sets of trajectories that can be transformed into each other by gradual bending and stretching without colliding with obstacles. The problem of finding least-cost paths restricted to a specific homotopy class or finding least-cost paths that do not belong to certain homotopy classes arises frequently in such applications as predicting paths for dynamic entities and computing heuristics for path planning with dynamic constraints. In the present work, we develop a compact way of representing homotopy classes and propose an efficient method of graph search-based optimal path planning with constraints on homotopy classes. The method is based on representing the environment of the robot as a complex plane and making use of the Cauchy Integral Theorem. We prove optimality of the method and show its efficiency experimentally.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses the path planning problem for robotic applications using homotopy classes. These classes provide a topological description of how paths avoid obstacles, which is an added value to the path planning problem. Homotopy classes are generated and sorted according to a lower bound heuristic estimator using a method we developed. Then, the classes are used to constrain and guide path planning algorithms. Three different path planners are presented and compared: a graph-search algorithm called Homotopic A? (HA?), a probabilistic sample-based algorithm called Homotopic \{RRT\} (HRRT), and a bug-based algorithm called Homotopic Bug (HBug). Our method has been tested in simulation and in an underwater bathymetric map to compute the trajectory of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). A comparison with well-known path planning algorithms has also been included. Results show that our homotopic path planners improve the quality of the solutions of their respective non-homotopic versions with similar computation time while keeping the topological constraints.},

We optimize a given path among obstacles in the plane under the Euclidean and link metrics and under polygonal convex distance functions. Besides revealing connections between the minimum paths under these three distance functions, the framework provided by the universal cover leads to simplified linear-time algorithms for shortest path trees, for minimum-link paths in simple polygons, and for paths restricted to c given orientations.},
