\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we model the particle swarm optimization by a networked structure.
The particles in the swarm forms a parallel connection with a global-best update as the feedback.
The dynamics of each particle has also been decomposed into an input-update component and a position-update component.
These decomposition enables us importing the input-to-state stable analysis into the PSO.
We provide the conditions that guarantee the convergence property of the PSO algorithm.
Our analysis starts from the particle level and then extends to the swarm level.
The optimal exploration depends on more factors, e.g. the fitness functions.
We analyze the cases that guarantee the swarm could find the optimal and propose the factors that help the swarm find the optimal.
We illustrate the pros and cons of the particles in the optimal search. 
Particularly, we show that how the particles organized into a swarm can facilitate the optimal search.
