\begin{abstract}
The stochastic behaviors of the particles and the swarm structure empower the capability of optimal search in PSO.
As well they increase the difficulty of understanding the dynamics of the PSO, i.e., whether the PSO will converge and how the PSO will converge.
The common methods of analyzing the PSO reply on the simplification of the algorithm, e.g., using stagnation assumption (a state where the swarm ceases finding better solutions) and constantizing the stochastic factors.
In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of the PSO by decompose the swarm and the particles into components.
We import input-to-state stability analysis to the decomposed components, which allows us to know the behavior of the convergence from a single particle to the entire swarm.
It enables the analysis of the PSO without any simplification and includes the influence to the particle when running in a swarm structure.


%Previous analysis of the dynamics of particle swarm optimization has often relied on either the assumption of ``stagnation'' (a state where the swarm ceases make progress), the removal of random effects, or both.
%In this paper we use a newer tool for the analysis of system dynamics, specifically the concept of Input to State Stability (ISS).
%ISS allows us to make statements about the behavior of the swarm not clearly address in previous analysis, specifically bounds on particle and swam behavior.
%We can also do so before stagnation and with random affect fully accounted for.
