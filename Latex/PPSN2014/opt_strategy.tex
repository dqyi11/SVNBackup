\section{The Stability after including Input Update Component}
\label{sec:opt_strgy}

In this section, we add the input update component that was first shown in Figure \ref{fig:sys_flow} and then analyze the convergence of particle position.

%For a minimization problem, the standard input update component is usually written as
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:update_b}
% x^{P}(k) = \arg \min_{ x \in \{ x(k), x^{P}(k-1) \} } f( x )
% \; and \;
% x^{G}(k) = \arg \min_{ x \in \{ x(k), X^{G}(k) \} } f( x ),
%\end{equation}
%in which $ X^{G}(k) $ is a set that contains the $ x^{G} (k) $ of all the particles.

Since by Theorem \ref{thm:iss} PSO is ISS, and therefore by Corollary \ref{coro:state_bound} the stability of the cascade system depends on the output of the input update component. We can say:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the input update component generates converging personal best and global best, the bound of the particle position will converge;
\item If the personal best and global best vary within a bound, the particle will converge within a bound;
\item If the personal best and global best become constant, the particle will converge to a point.
\end{enumerate}

Furthermore, by equation \eqref{eq:state_bound}, we know that the convergence of a particle's position $ x(k) $ to $ x^{*} $ depends on how $ x^{P}(k) $ and $ x^{G}(k) $ converge to $ x^{*} $, if the position update component is input-to-state stable.
In particular, the boundary of the distance between a particle's position and  $ x^{*} $ is determined by the initial distance $ x(0) -  x^{*} $, $ x^{P}(k) -  x^{*} $ and $ x^{G}(k) -  x^{*} $.

As the stagnation is defined that there is no new improvement found, we have that $ x^{P}(k) $ and $ x^{G}(k) $ are constant, which are $ x^{P} $ and $ x^{G} $ respectively.
If we assume that $ u^{P}(k) $ and $ u^{G}(k) $ are equivalent and constant, it is stated that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:single_obj_equilibrium}
\hat{x} = \frac{\phi^{P} x^{P} + \phi^{G} x^{G} }{ \phi^{P} + \phi^{G} } 
\end{equation}
is an equilibrium point for stagnation as noted in previous work \cite{985692}.

By letting $ x^{*} = \hat{x} $ be the reference point, and
by Corollary \ref{coro:state_bound}, we can go beyond prior work and can identify a bound on PSO behavior at stagnation:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:single_obj_input_bound}
\exists T, \forall k > T, 
| x(k) - \hat{x} | \leq  \gamma_{d} | [ x^{P} - \hat{x}, x^{G} - \hat{x} ]^{T} |,
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
 \gamma_{d} = \frac{ 2 \lVert A' \rVert^{2} \lVert B' \rVert^{2} + \lambda_{min}(Q') )^{2} \lVert B' \rVert^{2} }{ 2( \lambda_{min}(Q') )^{3} }.
\end{equation}
Particularly, when $ x^{P} = x^{G} $, we have
$ \hat{x} = x^{G} = x^{P} $.
By equation \eqref{eq:single_obj_input_bound}, we know that
$ \exists T , x(T) = x^{G} $, 
which means $ x(k) \rightarrow x^{G} $.
Thus we have shown the convergence of PSO in stagnation without the simplifying assumptions required by the work described in Section \ref{sec:relwork}.
