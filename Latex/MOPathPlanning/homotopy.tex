\section{Homotopy}

In a map without obstacles, the solution space is compact.
The import of obstacles breaks the compactness.
However, when there are a start point and an end point, a homotopy class of trajectories can be defined in a map with obstacles.
A \textbf{homotopy class} of trajectories is defined by the set of trajectories joining same start and end points which can be smoothly deformed into one another without intersecting obstacles~\cite{bhattacharya2010search}.
