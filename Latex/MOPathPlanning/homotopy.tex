\section{Homotopy}

In a map with obstacles, when there are a start point and an end point, a homotopy class of trajectories can be defined.
A \textbf{homotopy class} of trajectories is defined by the set of trajectories joining same start and end points which can be smoothly deformed into one another without intersecting obstacles~\cite{bhattacharya2010search}.
