\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have decomposed the PSO algorithm into a cascade model, which consists of input update and position update components.
We introduce the input-to-state stability analysis to the position update component.
For an input-to-state stable position update component, if the input to this component is bounded, the state is bounded; also if the input to the component converges, the state converges.
The convergence of the PSO is determined by the output of the input update component, which are the personal best and global best.
If they are in stagnation, the particle converges.

The analysis of a cascade structure used here can be applied to a wide range of the PSO variants.
In cases that use the same position update component but different input update components, the convergence and the boundary of the particles are determined by
whether the input update component generates converging or bounded personal best and global best.
For variants that use a different position update component, the ISS properties would need to be verified.
