\section{Swarm analysis}
\label{sec:swarm}

%\subsection{Consensus of a swarm}

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Combinations of ISS parts are ISS
%\item Swarm as such a combination
%\item Conditions where update is ISS
%\item trivially at stagnation. But also when on a single hill
%\end{itemize}

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Bound on swarm for the single hill case (perhaps as function of the width of the hill?
%Or width of the hill as a percentage of the feasible region?)
%\item test on 2-d case to show that the bound can prevent a particle from reaching another hill.
%This is one form of the swarm failing to converge the global optimal.
%\item Can we look at parameters for the whole swarm?
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{When the fitness distribution is a single hill}

\begin{mythm}
In one hill case, if there are more than two particles, $ x^{G} \rightarrow x^{*} $.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\end{mythm}

\subsubsection{Simulation}

\subsection{More than single hill case}

\begin{mythm}
The probability that the swarm finds a better global best depends on the probabilities that the particles find better global best, which is
\begin{equation}
P = 1 - \prod_{i=1}^{N} ( 1 - P_{i} ),
\end{equation}
$ P_{i} $ is the probability of particle $ i $ finds a better global best.
\end{mythm}

\subsubsection{Simulation}

\subsection{Value of a swarm}

%Being on one hill is the unlikely case bound in the multi hill case.
%Might not seem useful but is the essence of what makes a swarm a swarm.
%Bounds the swarm to a region around p-bests where g-best has been unable to pull other particles to its hill.
%For a function with narrow hills, g-bests on a narrow hills is less likely to capture another particle, thus the swarm searches more, for functions with broad hills, p-gest are more likely to be pulled to g-bests hill and search there.
%Thus swarm diversity is the mechanism that allows the swarm to not converge when searching is likely needed but focus and converge when the fitness landscape appear to favor exploitation.
%This does not happen at stagnation and does not happen without multiple members. <need to say this in a more mathematical way>>

%example ?? function for exploration case
%example sphere function for the exploitation case
%try to use bound as a function of hill width metric

%Rastrigin as a counter example? Does it get stuck or just sample for ever? It certainly runs longer.

\subsection{Diversity injection}

Work with the Rastrigin function has lead others to experiment with diversity injection to prevent pre-mature convergence (or prevent convergence at all)
I am not sure, do we want it to converge? ever?
On what basis would I propose a new algorithm?
Show that it would converge based on ISS?
