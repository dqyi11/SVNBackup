\section{Swarm analysis}
\label{sec:swarm}

\subsection{Consensus of a swarm}

Combinations of ISS parts are ISS

Swarm as such a combination

Conditions where update is ISS

trivially at stagnation
But also when on a single hill

Bound on swarm for the single hill case (perhaps as function of the width of the hill?
Or width of the hill as a percentage of the feasible region?)
test on 2-d case to show that the bound can prevent a particle    from reaching another hill.
This is one form of the swarm failing to converge the global optimal.

Can we look at parameters for the whole swarm?

\subsection{Value of a swarm}

Being on one hill is the unlikely case bound in the multi hill case.
Might not seem useful but is the essence of what makes a swarm a swarm.
Bounds the swarm to a region around p-bests where g-best has been unable to pull other particles to its hill.
For a function with narrow hills, g-bests on a narrow hills is less likely to capture another particle, thus the swarm searches more, for functions with broad hills, p-gest are more likely to be pulled to g-bests hill and search there.
Thus swarm diversity is the mechanism that allows the swarm to not converge when searching is likely needed but focus and converge when the fitness landscape appear to favor exploitation.
This does not happen at stagnation and does not happen without multiple members. <need to say this in a more mathematical way>>

example ?? function for exploration case
example sphere function for the exploitation case
try to use bound as a function of hill width metric

Rastrigin as a counter example? Does it get stuck or just sample for ever? It certainly runs longer.

\subsection{Diversity injection}

Work with the Rastrigin function has lead others to experiment with diversity injection to prevent pre-mature convergence (or prevent convergence at all)
I am not sure, do we want it to converge? ever?
On what basis would I propose a new algorithm?
Show that it would converge based on ISS?
