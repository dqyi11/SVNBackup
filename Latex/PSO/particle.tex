As in Figure \ref{fig:categorize_regions}, the solution space will be divided into three types of regions by the global best and the personal best.
\begin{itemize}
\item $ f(x) > f(x^G) $
Once a particle gets into this region, it updates both global best and personal best. 
It becomes a leader of the swarm.
\item $ f(x^{G}) > f(x) > f(x^{P}) $
Once a particle gets into this region, it updates only the personal best.
The solution space is then re-divided.
\item $ f(x) < f(x^{P}) $
When a particle is in this region, it only moves as a random walk.
\end{itemize}

The result of the movement of a particle is determined by which region of the solution space it moves in.
