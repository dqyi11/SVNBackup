%The ability to analyze the behavior of the swarm before stagnation is important.
%Because at stagnation the mechanism for sharing information among the particles in the swarm has been reduced to a constant, it is merely a collection of independent agents.
%The sharing of information is what make the swarm a swarm. 

In PSO, ``stagnation'' is usually defined as the personal best and global best keep constant over some time steps \cite{4223160}.
Plenty of work have focused on the behavior of a particle when this happens, particularly where it converges to. [TODO: cite some work]
While the global best is not changed, there exists no information sharing among the particles.
The swarm becomes merely a collection of independent agents.

In many cases, the personal best is more frequently updated than the global best.
Particularly, when the personal best and the global best are inconsistent, there exists no real convergence of a particle's position, which is given in Property \ref{prop:unconverge_neq_gb}.
\begin{myprop}
\label{prop:unconverge_neq_gb}
A particle won't stop moving when its personal best and global best are not the same, 
which means that 
$ \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} v(k) \neq 0 $, if $ x^{P} \neq x^{G} $.
\end{myprop}

In order to know better on the dynamics of the PSO, we need more results of the swarm behavior before stagnation.
