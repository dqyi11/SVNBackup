\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

``Stagnation'' appears frequently in the search process of evolutionary optimization algorithms. 
It is commonly considered as that the algorithm stops finding a better solution.
In particle swarm optimization, ``stagnation'' is usually defined as the personal best and global best keep constant over some time steps \cite{4223160}.
``Stagnation'' is a very important phenomenon in analyzing the behavior and the optimization search capability of the particle swarm optimization.
Plenty of work have focused on the behavior of a particle when this happens, particularly where it converges to. [TODO: cite some work]

Instead of viewing the optimization process as a random search and stopping at a ``stagnation'', we find that ``stagnation'' happens frequently during the search process.
The swarm behavior leads that the global best would be unchanged for a great share of the entire search time.
As a way of finding a new global best, the personal best of a particle is more frequently changed while the global best is unchanged. 
Define the period of time that the global best is unchanged as one ``stagnation''.
The process of particle swarm optimization consists of a sequence of stagnations, of which the global best is refined in a newer stagnation.

While the global best is not changed in a single stagnation, there also exists no information sharing among the particles.
The swarm becomes merely a collection of independent agents.
In the stagnation, the particles have no interaction with each other.
There exists a potential competition.
The particle that finds a better solution takes over the global best and triggers a new stagnation.

Due to the non-zero force on the motion of the particle, when the personal best and the global best are inconsistent, there exists no real convergence of a particle's position, which is given in Property \ref{prop:unconverge_neq_gb}.
\begin{myprop}
\label{prop:unconverge_neq_gb}
A particle won't stop moving when its personal best and global best are not the same, 
which means that 
$ \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} v(k) \neq 0 $, if $ x^{P} \neq x^{G} $.
\end{myprop}
In order to know better on the dynamics of the PSO, we need more results of the swarm behavior before stagnation.
