\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we model the particle swarm optimization by a networked structure.
By importing the input-to-state stability analysis, we could know the conditions that provide the convergence property of the PSO algorithm.
The optimal exploration depends on more factors, particularly the fitness functions.
We analyze the cases that guarantee the swarm could find the optimal and propose the factors that help the swarm find the optimal.
We illustrate the pros and cons of the particles in the optimal search. 
Particularly, we show that how the particles organized into a swarm can facilitate the optimal search.
