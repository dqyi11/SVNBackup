\end{figure}

Fig.\ref{fig:command} defines a parser for a command format. $ <CommandPhrase> $ usually defines a task type. The domain of $ <BuildingType> $ and $ <Feature> $ are from predefined semantic labels. $ <PrepPhrase> $ and $ <FeatureQuantifier> $ gives the relationship with semantic labelled positions. $ <Adverb> $ rules the pattern of the trajectory.

Intuitively, the objectives in a command can be categorized into ``strong" and ``weak". Usually, the $ <BuildingType> $, $ <Feature> $ , $ <PrepPhrase> $ and $ <FeatureQuantifier> $ forms some ``strong" objectives. Implicitly, it expects an agent visiting some key positions defined from semantic. At the same time, $ <Adverb> $ shows ``weak" objective. It means with those key positions visited, the robot is expected to move in some expected pattern. Particularly, if a ``strong" objective violates a ``weak" objective, a ``strong" objective should be guaranteed. 




\section{Structure}

Assume the objectives inside a command can be divided into two types, we can import two key factors to a semantic-based path planning problem. One is ``waypoint" and the other is ``trajectory shape". ``waypoint" is used to satisfy the requirement on the constraint with semantic label, while ``trajectory shape" is determined by adverb.

I suggest to decompose the planning into two layers as in Fig.\ref{fig:planningLayer}, "waypoint layer" and ``spline layer".
\begin{itemize}
\item ``Waypoint layer" is the high layer, which is an abstract from smantic meaning of a command. It contains a sequence of waypoints that determines the coarse shape of a path. It can be presented in either discrete space or continuous space. This forms an abstract from semantic meaning of a command. 
\item ``Spline layer" is the lower layer is a set of splines connecting the waypoints by order. It generates the fine shape of each segment in the entire path. This layer is agent-dependent, how the shape is like depends on the task assigned to an agent and the capability of an agent. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

\label{fig:planningLayer}
\end{figure}

For example, if an robot is assigned to a search task and is required to reach to a specific position at some time. ``Waypoint layer" gives the key waypoints. Because the robot is still in the task of search, it will explore as large region as possible with considering on the maximum speed of the agent, which determines how the spline is like.
