\section{Swarm behavior}

As we know, the optimization search process of the PSO is finding a better global best.
Because each particle will either converge to the current global best or trigger a new global best.
The optimization search process depends how the particles can trigger a new global best.

\begin{lemma}
Let $ P_{i} $ be the probability that particle $ i $ finds the global optimal.
The probability that a swarm of $ N $ particles finds the global optimal is
$ 1 - \prod_{i=1}^{N} (1 - P_{i}) $.
\end{lemma}
