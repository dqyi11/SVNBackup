\title{Dynamics of Particle Swarm}

\date{}

\maketitle

In order to understand what happens in a PSO(Particle swarm optimization), people are usually interested with the ``exploration and exploitation'' of this algorithm.
\begin{itemize}
\item ``Exploration'' means \textbf{search capability}, which determines how likely the particles could find local best and global best;
\item ``Exploitation'' leads to \textbf{convergence}, which shows how the particles utilize the found current best.
It also tells what happens on the swarm behavior when no new global best can be found.
\end{itemize}

There is no guarantee that PSO could always find a global optimal.
It is not hard to give an example that the global optimal could not be found. 
The factors impact the likelihood that the global optimal is found include:
\begin{itemize}
\item number of particles,
\item $ \chi $, $ \phi^{P} $, $ \phi^{G} $,
\item and the distribution of the fitness space.
\end{itemize}

Our analysis will focus on a standard PSO.
It includes the canonical update rule and a ring topology (single and consistent global best).

Define three types of agents in a particle swarm, which are \emph{particle agent}, \emph{global best agent} and \emph{personal best agent}.
We can have a topology of the swarm in a ring structure, as in Figure \ref{fig:topology3}.

\end{figure}

By this structure, we can see that the interaction between particles are determined by the global best.
It means that when the global best is not changed, the interaction between particles is broken.
If both the global best and personal best are not changed, the interaction between dimensions in a particle is also broken.
