\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

In this paper, we use a human path to form a path constraint and seek to maximize the information gathered by a robot gathered in a search task.
The resulting information maximization path planning is identified as a constrained submodular orienteering problem on a multi-partite graph.
We present an anytime algorithm that used a planning heuristic based on backtracking to efficiently find a high quality path.
We use a node freeze process to avoid an exhaustive search, yet we prove that this process always preserves the ability of the algorithm to find an optimal solution.
We have also shown empirically that this approach substantially reduces the complexity of the resulting search.
