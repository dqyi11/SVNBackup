The information maximization path planning of a robot wingman in a team search task has been formed as a submodular orienteering problem on a multi-partite graph.
We proposed an algorithm of tree expanding with recursive backtracking to find a near-optimal solution. 
It is integrated into an anytime algorithm framework to explore optimal, in which node freeze process is used to improve search efficiency.
We proved that the algorithm can always find the optimal and use simulation to analyze the performance in different cases.
The algorithm shows significant increase on search efficiency when the problem size becomes large.
