\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

In order to support the task-oriented collaboration in a human-robot team, natural language can be used for the interaction between the human and the robot.
A shared mental model is needed for the collaboration to help the team members understand each other correctly.
The shared mental model is initialized through a semantic labeling process.
With a labeled world model and a task grammar, a robot can translate a verbal command from the supervisor into a multi-objective path planning problem.
A human interactive decision making process is introduced to find the preferred solution and correct the potential bias from the problem modeling.
The planned path can be interactively obtained from the Pareto solution set.
